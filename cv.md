# Profile

Hey, my name is Hanna! :wink:  
I am a medical engineer according to education, but I worked as a Patent Attorney Assistant, creating applications for patents (including the work with Software) for 4 years. But I didn't feel any pleasure from this job and one day I decided to change my life for immersing in interesting for me area. I'm a good communicator and responsible team player, who is able to think outside the box. And now I'm here and ready to develop, to work hard, to get knowledges.  
I believe that my way in the field of front-end development will be successful! :flushed:
